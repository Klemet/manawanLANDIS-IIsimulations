# 👋 Welcome ! 

**⚙️ This repository contains files and information about the parameters used for simulating the Manawan area with the model LANDIS-II for the DIVERSE project.**

In particular, **this repository describes how these parameters were obtained or determined**, and which parameters were used for the different simulations made during the project.

**📊 The repository also contains results from the simulations, along with an analysis of these results.**

**🔒 The content of the repository is currently locked to protect data and parameters shared by collaborators.**
